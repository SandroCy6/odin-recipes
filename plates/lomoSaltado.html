    <h1>Lomo Saltado (Peruvian Steak Stir-Fry)</h1>
    <p>
        I've never been a big stir-fry guy, but when it comes to lomo saltado, I make an exception. First of all, it's
        Peruvian — and I love to eat anything Peruvian. But, it's also a stir-fry that features not only meat and
        vegetables, but also French fries. Serve with steamed white rice and garnish with cilantro, if so desired.

        <h2>directions</h2>
        <h4>step 1</h4>
        <p>Slice beef horizontally into 1/4-inch strips and transfer into a mixing bowl. Add 1 tablespoon of soy sauce,
            and the sugar. Mix well and place in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour; longer is fine.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>step 2</h4>
        <p>Preheat an oven to 200 degrees F (90 degrees C). Line a sheet pan with a silicone liner (such as Silpat®).
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>step 3</h4>
        <p>Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large, nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add French fries and cook
            until golden and crisp, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer to the prepared pan and place in the preheated oven to keep
            warm.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>step 4</h4>
        <p>Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in the same skillet over high heat until the oil begins to smoke. Sear the beef
            strips in 2 or 3 smaller batches, until browned but still pink in places, for 1 to 2 minutes per batch. You
            don't want to cook the meat all the way through, as it will finish cooking with the vegetables later. As
            each batch of beef is browned, transfer to a plate or bowl, and reserve.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>step 5</h4>
        <p>Place the skillet back over high heat, and add remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil. Transfer in red onion, bell
            pepper, habanero, and green onion, along with a large pinch of salt. Cook, stirring, until the onions and
            peppers just begin to soften, 3 to 5 minutes.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>step 6</h4>
        <p>Add garlic and ginger to the pan; cook and stir for 1 minute. Add tomato wedges and cook, stirring, until
            they begin to soften and start to release their juices, about 3 minutes. Add remaining 2 tablespoons of soy
            sauce, white vinegar, and the browned beef into the pan, along with any accumulated juices, and stir to
            combine.</p>
        <h4>step 7</h4>
        <p>Stir cilantro and crispy, cooked French fries into the pan, tossing everything to combine. Taste for salt and
            adjust if needed. Serve immediately.</p>

        <h3>chef´s notes</h3>
        <p>If you wanted to splurge, you could use a nicer cut of meat, such as a filet, New York strip, or skirt steak.

            I like to use frozen, crinkle-cut fries, but any kind will do. You can serve the fries on the side of this
            dish to keep them from getting soggy, but I've heard that the real players always serve them in it.</p>
