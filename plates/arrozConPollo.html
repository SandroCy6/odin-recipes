    <h1>Peruvian Arroz con Pollo (Peruvian Rice and Chicken)</h1>
    <p>
        This is a Peruvian rice and chicken dish made with cilantro and a special Peruvian kick. It's very delicious. My
        Peruvian father-in-law said that mine was even better than his sister's, who is one of the best cooks in the
        family (besides my mother-in-law)! Goes great with Huancaina sauce and salsa Criolla.

        <h2>directions</h2>
        <h4>step 1</h4>
        <p>Season chicken with salt and pepper.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>step 2</h4>
        <p>Heat a large saucepan over medium-high heat with enough oil to coat the bottom. Brown chicken in hot oil on
            all sides, 5 to 7 minutes total. Remove chicken onto a plate.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>step 3</h4>
        <p>Pour more oil into the saucepan and add onion; sauté until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and
            sauté, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in cilantro, chile paste, salt, and pepper. Sauté until cilantro turns dark
            green, 3 to 5 minutes. Pour in chicken broth and deglaze, scraping browned bits off the bottom of the
            saucepan with a wooden spoon. Bring to a light simmer; let simmer for 3 to 5 minutes.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>step 4</h4>
        <p>Transfer mixture carefully to an electric blender and purée.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>step 5</h4>
        <p>Heat more oil in the same saucepan over medium-high heat; sauté bell pepper in hot oil until soft, about 5
            minutes. Return puréed cilantro mixture to the saucepan and add chicken. Cover, reduce heat to low, and cook
            until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 20 to 30 minutes. Remove chicken to
            a clean plate.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>step 6</h4>
        <p>Add water and rice to the same saucepan, adding more water if it doesn't look like enough. Bring to a boil;
            cover, reduce heat to low, and cook until all liquid is absorbed and rice is tender, 20 to 40 minutes. Stir
            in peas and carrots and chicken and cook until warmed through, 5 to 10 minutes.</p>
