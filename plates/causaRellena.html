    <h1>Peruvian Potato-Chicken Salad (Causa Rellena)</h1>
    <p>
        This layered Peruvian potato and chicken salad is called "causa rellena" in Peru. There's nothing very unusual
        about serving a chicken or potato salad at a cookout but this beautiful layered salad is sure to cause a stir!
        Perfect for making ahead and packing in your cooler on a hot summer day. Garnish with cherry tomatoes and
        cilantro if desired.

        <h2>directions</h2>
        <h4>step 1</h4>
        <p>Combine chicken, green peas, carrot, shallot, roasted red peppers, cilantro, and lime juice in a bowl. Season
            with salt and cayenne. Add mayonnaise and mix until combined. Cover chicken salad with plastic wrap and
            refrigerate until ready to use.</p>
        <h4>step 2</h4>
        <p>Place potatoes into a pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer
            until very tender but not falling apart, about 20 minutes. Drain well and transfer potatoes to a mixing
            bowl. Mash until smooth.</p>
        <h4>step 3</h4>
        <p>Add ají amarillo, olive oil, and lime juice to the potatoes. Season with cayenne and salt. Mash together with
            a potato masher. Switch to a spatula and mix until completely smooth.</p>
        <h4>step 4</h4>
        <p>Line four 6-ounce ramekins with plastic wrap. Scoop mashed potatoes evenly into ramekins; press and smooth
            out the tops. Cover each with a layer of avocado slices. Fill each ramekin to the top with chicken salad,
            pressing it down and pulling up the plastic wrap to eliminate any air pockets. Cover with a final layer of
            mashed potatoes, going up to 1/2 inch or more over the rim.</p>
        <h4>step 5</h4>
        <p>Seal top with a new layer of plastic wrap and fold the sides over to seal. Refrigerate salads until
            completely chilled, at least 1 hour.</p>
        <h4>step 6</h4>
        <p>Mix mayonnaise, sour cream, garlic, and ají amarillo together for the sauce, adding a splash of water to
            adjust the thickness.</p>
        <h4>step 7</h4>
        <p>Remove the top layer of plastic wrap from each salad. Invert each ramekin onto a serving plate; remove
            ramekins, then plastic wrap. Spoon some sauce around each salad.</p>

        <h3>chef´s notes</h3>
        <p>If you can't find ají amarillo, you can make a paste from some fire-roasted and peeled orange or red bell
            peppers, with red Fresno chilies for some heat. While this does get you close, you should definitely try to
            find a jar of the real stuff, since it does have such a unique flavor.</p>
