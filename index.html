            <p>This layered Peruvian potato and chicken salad is called "causa rellena" in Peru. There's nothing very
                unusual about serving a chicken or potato salad at a cookout but this beautiful layered salad is sure to
                cause a stir! Perfect for making ahead and packing in your cooler on a hot summer day. Garnish with
                cherry tomatoes and cilantro if desired.</p>

            </div>
            <p>I've never been a big stir-fry guy, but when it comes to lomo saltado, I make an exception. First of all,
                it's Peruvian â€” and I love to eat anything Peruvian. But, it's also a stir-fry that features not only
                meat and vegetables, but also French fries. Serve with steamed white rice and garnish with cilantro, if
                so desired.</p>

            </div>
            <p>This is a Peruvian rice and chicken dish made with cilantro and a special Peruvian kick. It's very
                delicious. My Peruvian father-in-law said that mine was even better than his sister's, who is one of the
                best cooks in the family (besides my mother-in-law)! Goes great with Huancaina sauce and salsa Criolla.

            <p>I grew up in Japan, and my Mother got this recipe from some Catholic nuns there during the 50's. It's
                been a family favorite ever since. If you're a vegetarian, try this sauce with vegetables only. It's
                wonderful that way also!</p>
